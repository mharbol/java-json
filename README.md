# JSON in Java
Project on hold for a bit. Got it working very nicely elsewhere and this was just a proof of concept
to show that it wasn't too hard.
Will complete in the future after a few other projects get complete.

Lots of these out there but this is special becuase I made it.
This project is to show that it is relatively easy to make a (mostly) working JSON parser.
The first iteration is a quick util and then it will improve over time to have better features and errors.
